				<p>
					TwistedMnMs is my game and this is my fame. I don't know about you but MnM's are life
					this is why we should join together. I am Riley, I'm 19 and hate the cold. I pretty much stay
					inside and play Xbox and watch Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc. 
					but every other day or so I put in some exercise. I work at 
					PieFive pizza right now but soon transfering to Maes Gelateria
					which is the best place in town ;). This is my second semester at OTC and 
					looking to do better in school this semester by getting all A's and B's but mostly A's ;).

					In case anyone was wondering, no I am tottaly not obsessed with M&Ms but in case
					any of you are I will make sure you have a wonderful picture of M&Ms just below this.
					Hope all of this helps the craze for M&Ms since I support them all the way.
